Right now we have five general purpose user levels.

User level 0 is a regular user. Level 0 can edit their own 
profiles. This is the default user level.

User level 1 is a privileged user. Level 1 can view information created 
by others that they have chosen to share.

User level 2 is a data analyst. Level 2 can submit jobs to a 
supercomputer for analysis.

User level 3 is a local admin user. Level 3 can view and edit profile 
information about other users, as well as work with their data.

User level 4 is for super users. They have admin access to all databases, 
can view pages that display information about multiple databases, and can 
delete running jobs from any database.

And then we have one more user level not for general use, the super
admin user. This is user level 5, which is really supposed to be just for
LIMS developers. It's just like user level 4, and adds a MySQL 
command window.
