Right now we have three general purpose user levels.

User level 0 is a regular user. Level 0 can edit their own 
profiles. This is the default user level.

User level 1 is a privileged user. 

User level 2 is a data analyst.

User level 3 is a super user. Level 3 can view information
about other users.

User level 4 is for admin users. They can view or edit information
about other users.

And then we have one more user level not for general use, the super
admin. This is user level 5, which is really supposed to be just for
me to use when I'm developing. It's just like user level 4, and adds a
MySQL command window.
